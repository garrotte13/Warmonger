[mod-setting-name]
wm-BiomassToBitersReseach=Amount of Biomass per 1 Biters Research Data item
wm-CreepMiningPollution=Amount of Pollution generated per each Creep tile excavated
wm-CreepMiningTilesPerCycle=Amount of Creep tiles excavated by Creep Miner per work cycle
wm-CreepCorrosion=Enable Corrosion by Creep
wm-CounterStrike=Enable Biter's Nests counter-strikes (requires enabled Corrosion)
[mod-setting-description]
wm-BiomassToBitersReseach=Recommended value is 7, but for double Technology cost value of 4 is recommended.
wm-CreepMiningPollution=Pollution is generated at miner location. Default value is 1.5 . Reduce accordingly when pollution absorption is decreased (e.g. 0.9 for classic Deathworld map setup).
wm-CreepMiningTilesPerCycle=Default value is 7. Don't touch it unless you know game balance.
wm-CreepCorrosion=Any building installed on creep tiles will corrode - loose hitpoints due to acid DoT (Evolution speeds up the process!). Damage effect diminishes with structure health and stops when a few hitpoints % are left.
wm-CounterStrike=Biters nests will counter attack with corrosion seeds sometimes when nearby nests are destroyed remotely. Minimum distance to trigger attack increases with evolution. Artillery and nuke fans - beware!
