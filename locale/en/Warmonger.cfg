wm-BiomassToBitersReseach=Amount of Biomass per 1 Biters Research Data item
wm-CreepMiningPollution=Amount of Pollution generated per each Creep tile excavated
wm-CreepMiningPollution_s=Creep Miner emissions coefficient
wm-CreepMiningTilesPerCycle=Amount of Creep tiles excavated by Creep Miner per work cycle
wm-CreepCorrosion=Enable Corrosion by Creep
wm-CounterStrike=Enable Biter's Nests counter-strikes
wm-CreepMinerHints=Show hints when Creep Miner is blocked
wm-CreepMinerFueling=Automatically refuel burner Creep Miner
wm-ecoFriendlyBiters=Biters revive trees they destroy

[mod-setting-description]
wm-BiomassToBitersReseach=Set 0 to have no need in biomass for military science. For double technology cost a halved value is recommended unless playing vs aggressively expanding natives.
wm-CreepCorrosion=Any building installed on creep tiles will corrode - loose hitpoints due to acid DoT (Evolution speeds up the process!). Damage effect diminishes with structure health and stops when a few hitpoints % are left. Changing the setting applies to new events.
wm-CounterStrike=Biters nests will counter attack with corrosion seeds sometimes when nearby nests are destroyed remotely. Minimum distance to trigger attack increases with evolution. Artillery and nuke fans - beware!
wm-CreepMinerHints=Show flying text hints about the reason creep miner stopped working while there is still creep in its range.
wm-CreepMinerFueling=Half stack of available fuel is inserted. Fuel with least pollution coefficient is selected. Gathered bio residue is inserted as fuel when no free slots are available in linked chest or when out of fuel.
wm-ecoFriendlyBiters=Biters respect and revive local flora they destroy on the way. Trees return in about 15 minutes. Especially useful with Rampant.
