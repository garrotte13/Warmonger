wm-BiomassToBitersReseach=Amount of Biomass per 1 Biters Research Data item
wm-CreepMiningPollution=Amount of Pollution generated per each Creep tile excavated
wm-CreepMiningPollution_s=Amount of Pollution generated per each Creep tile excavated
wm-CreepMiningTilesPerCycle=Amount of Creep tiles excavated by Creep Miner per work cycle
wm-CreepCorrosion=Enable Corrosion by Creep
wm-CounterStrike=Enable Biter's Nests counter-strikes (requires enabled Corrosion)
wm-CreepMinerHints=Show hints when Creep Miner is blocked
wm-CreepMinerFueling=Automatically refuel burner Creep Miner
[mod-setting-description]
wm-BiomassToBitersReseach=Recommended value is 7, but for double Technology cost value of 4 is recommended.
wm-CreepMiningPollution=Pollution is generated at miner location. Default value is 1.5 . Reduce accordingly when pollution absorption is decreased (e.g. 0.9 for classic Deathworld map setup).
wm-CreepMiningPollution_s=Creep miner pollution generated per creep tile. Default value is 1. Reduce proportionally when pollution absorption modifiers are decreased (e.g. please set 0.5 for classic Deathworld map setup).
wm-CreepMiningTilesPerCycle=Default value is 7. Don't touch it unless you know game balance.
wm-CreepCorrosion=Any building installed on creep tiles will corrode - loose hitpoints due to acid DoT (Evolution speeds up the process!). Damage effect diminishes with structure health and stops when a few hitpoints % are left. Changing the setting applies to new events.
wm-CounterStrike=Biters nests will counter attack with corrosion seeds sometimes when nearby nests are destroyed remotely. Minimum distance to trigger attack increases with evolution. Artillery and nuke fans - beware!
wm-CreepMinerHints=Show flying text hints about the reason creep miner stopped working while there is still creep in its range.
wm-CreepMinerFueling=Half stack of available fuel is inserted. Fuel with least pollution coefficient is selected. Gathered bio residue is inserted as fuel when no free slots are available in linked chest or when out of fuel.
