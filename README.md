# Warmonger
Creep for vanilla Factiorio completely based on Krastorio2 code (ver 1.2.x). Thanks to Krastor, Linver, raiguard and their supporters for that.

Only creep-related staff, biters research and bio lab are taken from Krastorio.

Main goal of Warmonger mod is to add challenge and interest for warfare-focused players via small mods, without Factorio complete overhaul - no need in new blueprints books, no pain of broken balance like free Petroleum or free fuel, no long production chains and cheat loaders. Add it with other mods if you need to.

Creep must be harvested for military technologies progress. In the endgame less creep is required, but no way to completely automate and produce biomass without fighting  native fauna.

Changes comparing to K2 feature:
- creep absorbs much less pollution,
- creep footprint grows with evolution,
- creep damages buildings (e.g. "turrel creep" requires timely repairing them), can be turned off in console with command "/disable-corrosion"
- creep is collected by special buildings, not manually. Graphics for them was taken from Amator Phasma Coal&Steam and Yuoki Industries mods.
- creep can be collected only after purging enemy nests and worms nearby. Abuse with path tiles replacement is allowed.
- biters are immune to any viruses,
- no peaceful game mode is expected in any form. Biomass is heavily used in midgame and later on for military science packs and Rampant Arsenal items. There are a lot of Factorio great mods for pure automation joy (Krastorio2, IR2, AAI-Industry, SE, B&A and many others).

Mod is tested for compatibility with Rampant, Rampant Arsenal and Rampant Industry. I use SpaceX for endgame, but would be glad to find alternative (no luck so far).
Rampant New Enemies mode is not conflicting with creep generation.

Future plans - test and fix balance.
