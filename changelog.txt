Version: 1.0.1
Date: 2021-12-02
    - Balance fixes (1 biomass unit => 1 military science pack, and 90% chance to collect) and smaller creep areas generated, because Rampant1.* enemies are sieging a lot providing tons of creep.
    - Creep can't be collected near nests and worms anymore (other abuses are sill possible, e.g. replace with path tiles).

Version: 1.0.0
Date: 2021-11-30
  Features:
    - Alpha version
	- Creep pollution absorption per tile is set as 5 dead trees (100 times less than in K2)
	- Biters research output set to make 4 science packs per biomass unit and 40 via bio-lab.
Rampant agression abuse allows to collect up to 1k biomass in 10 minutes of middle-game (400% bases frequency, 10 max tier of new enemies, 70% evo, MK3 armor).
Need to validate this Rampant abuse possibility with 150% bases frequency.
