Version: 1.2.5
Date: 2021-12-20
  Changes:
    - Changed icon for fake creep
    - 8 biomass to 1 biters research
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.4
Date: 2021-12-19
  Changes:
    - Fixed creep collection restriction issue when selecting areas with several creep footprints. Now true creep only from one patch a time will be collected.
    - Creep generation optimizations and balance. 2-3 times less biomass compared to enemies bases generated by version 1.1.1 (replaced by fake creep till the same total amount).
    - More biomass from bases of the same nests/worms count with evolution growth. Generated creep patch area increasing with evolution growth is doubled.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.3
Date: 2021-12-16
  Changes:
    - Footprint generation (more optimizations, less biomass in big late game areas).
    - Fix for fake creep deconstruction (bots will bring back some unexpected ingredients, because they are forced by Wube to bring you something...).
    - Complete logics change for creep collecting restrictions. Simple large protection range for Rampant new enemies mode is replaced with some smart restrictions for everyone.
    - Fake creep has only basic restriction. Should work fine with Creeper2 and future Warmonger late game specials.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.2
Date: 2021-12-13
  Changes:
    - Improved creep footprint generation (optimized and higher diversity in distal tiles).
    - All creep generation changes and features (changes 1.1.2-1.2.2) became available in games with no Rampant mod or with disabled its New Enemies mode.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.1
Date: 2021-12-12
  Changes:
    - Fixed a common problem (not only for Creeper2) - Gathering creep failed when no true creep was selected.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.0
Date: 2021-12-12
  Changes:
    - Introducing another creep type ("fake creep") with no biomass derivatives, but the same creep in everything else. We need it to support Creeper mod fork and another planned Warmonger feature. And to turn off demotivating random collecting (see below).
    - Changed creep deployment footprint: it's not a perfect circle anymore, but has some random elements in distal tiles - fake creep or no creep at all.
    - Creep collector doesn't loose biomass anymore (was spoiling random ~10% biomass in 1.1.3 and ~50% in original Krastorio2). Should be a balance vs fake creep elements.
    - Planted creep searches and initiates corrosion for player's buildings it touches (Rampant's SiegeAI, forked Creeper mod ?). Creep deployment speed has been decreased on 30% to negate possible performance issues.
    - If Rampant New Enemies is On, creep is generated only via API now to avoid double creep generation. With Rampant 1.1.1 it leads to no creep around nests/worms in starting area chunks (fixed in Rampant 2.0).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.3
Date: 2021-12-08
  Changes:
    - Rampant Arsenal repair capsule now requires 2 biomass => reactive mending walls and medic repair capsule will need biomass.
    - Rampant Arsenal MK3 shield and armor also require some biomass.
    - Rampant Industry air filter buildings and advanced repair pack now require biomass.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.2
Date: 2021-12-06
  Changes:
    - API-triggered creep generation changed to work slower in queue. Thanks a lot to Veden! That should be a performance fix for late game with 1k+ Rampant nests/worms on map.
    - Added distinctive sound for creep collecting blocked by natives nearby.
    - Added experimental sound for corrosion. Unintentionally was synced with Factorio vanilla animation :-)
    - Removed chunk alignment for Rampant new enemies mode creep protection. 2 chunks radius.
    - Balance. 7 biomass units for every 2 military science packs. I gather up to 1200 biomass from one biters base (~11 nests, ~12 worms) - quite a lot even for double tech cost difficulty.
    - Industrial Revolution 2 compatibility added. Not sure that I got mod idea properly (military science is available only in midgame, not many tech&items depend on it). Who plays with IR2, pls give feedback.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.1
Date: 2021-12-05
  Changes:
    - Poison capsule now additionally requires 1 biomass. A small change for vanilla, but a crucial one for Rampant Arsenal.
    - Balance. Reducing to 5 biomass units for every 2 military science packs.
    - Balance. Creep footprint grows a little faster with evo.
    - Fixed Warmonger world map creep-collector abuse, because it can happen unintentionally unlike replacing with path tiles.
    - Fixed crash on robot placing building ( Thanks to illiander42 )
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.0
Date: 2021-12-05
  Changes:
    - Balance fixes (3 biomass into 1 military science pack, 95% chance to collect, stack 400). Should be good now.
    - Creep footprint slowly increases with evolution. Together with Rampant 1.2.0 enemy structures upgrade it will foster creep areas for old bases.
    - Creep gathering is more restricted for Rampant new enemies mode (Free adjacent chunks are required). For no 'new enemies' game old miserable restriction slowly grows with evo.
    - Creep damages buildings (10% per second, but 5+ hp will be left).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.1
Date: 2021-12-02
  Changes:
    - Balance fixes (1 biomass unit => 1 military science pack, and 90% chance to collect) and smaller creep areas generated, because Rampant1.* enemies are sieging a lot providing tons of creep.
    - Creep can't be collected near nests and worms anymore (other abuses are sill possible, e.g. replace with path tiles).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.0
Date: 2021-11-30
  Features:
    - Alpha version
    - Creep pollution absorption per tile is set as 5 dead trees (100 times less than in K2)
    - Biters research output set to make 4 science packs per biomass unit and 40 via bio-lab.
