Version: 1.1.1
Date: 2021-12-05
  Changes:
    - Poison capsule now additionally requires 1 biomass. A small change for vanilla, but a crucial one for Rampant Arsenal.
    - Balance. Reducing to 5 biomass units for every 2 military science packs.
    - Balance. Creep footprint grows a little faster with evo.
    - Fixed Warmonger world map creep-collector abuse, because it can happen unintentionally unlike replacing with path tiles.

Version: 1.1.0
Date: 2021-12-05
  Changes:
    - Balance fixes (3 biomass into 1 military science pack, 95% chance to collect, stack 400). Should be good now.
    - Creep footprint slowly increases with evolution. Together with Rampant 1.2.0 enemy structures upgrade it will foster creep areas for old bases.
    - Creep gathering is more restricted for Rampant new enemies mode (Free adjacent chunks are required). For no 'new enemies' game old miserable restriction slowly grows with evo.
    - Creep damages buildings (10% per second, but 5+ hp will be left).

Version: 1.0.1
Date: 2021-12-02
  Changes:
    - Balance fixes (1 biomass unit => 1 military science pack, and 90% chance to collect) and smaller creep areas generated, because Rampant1.* enemies are sieging a lot providing tons of creep.
    - Creep can't be collected near nests and worms anymore (other abuses are sill possible, e.g. replace with path tiles).
