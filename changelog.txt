Version: 1.1.0
Date: 2021-12-05
  Changes:
    - Balance fixes (3 biomass into 1 military science pack, 95% chance to collect, stack 400). Should be good now.
    - Creep gathering is more restricted for Rampant new enemies mode (Free adjacent chunks are required).
    - Creep damages buildings (10% per second, but 5+ hp will be left).

Version: 1.0.1
Date: 2021-12-02
  Changes:
    - Balance fixes (1 biomass unit => 1 military science pack, and 90% chance to collect) and smaller creep areas generated, because Rampant1.* enemies are sieging a lot providing tons of creep.
    - Creep can't be collected near nests and worms anymore (other abuses are sill possible, e.g. replace with path tiles).
